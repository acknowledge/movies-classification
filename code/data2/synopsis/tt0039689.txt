With Kathie's help, Whit had planned the murder of Eels and hoped to frame Jeff for it. Jeff also learns that Kathie told Whit that it was Jeff who killed his ex-partner Fisher, and among Eels' papers is an affidavit she signed naming Jeff as the killer. Jeff goes to Whits night club, slugs the manager and takes the tax papers. He tries to trade them for the affidavit, but the plan goes awry.Joe tries to hunt down Jeff on a small river, but when he tries to shoot Jeff, Jimmy hooks him with a fishing line and pulls him in the river, where he drowns.Later, when Jeff again tries to meet with Whit, he finds Kathie has killed him.

They leave together, but soon come upon a police roadblock. Kathie realizes Jeff has double-crossed her. She shoots Jeff with a small revolver. The police then fire on their car, killing both Kathie and Jeff.After Jeff's funeral Ann asks his assistant,The Kid, if Jeff was really going away with Kathie. The Kid indicates he was. Ann drives off with Jim, who's always loved her. The Kid lied because he knew it's what Jeff would have wanted. Ann would never marry Jim if she thought Jeff really loved her and hadn't lied to her.
