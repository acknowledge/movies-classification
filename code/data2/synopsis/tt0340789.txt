For thousands of years, the creeper has come back to life every 23 years to feast on humans for 23 days. It is now day 22 and with only two days left of feasting, the creeper must find new victims before his time is up. The bat-like creeper has greater strength with his ability to fly. The story begins with the creeper as a scarecrow in a cornfield waiting to snatch the child of Jack Taggart (Ray Wise) who ends up wanting revenge on the creeper after he flies away with his son. This leads to the 23rd and last day of the creeper. A busload of high school basketball players, cheerleaders, and coaches are returning home after a Championship game on East 9 Highway. The creeper throws a spike made from the body parts of other victims and blows out one of the bus tires. As night falls, the creeper swoops down and takes the coaches away, and then he begins to feast on the terrified teenagers. This is the creeper's last night and he loves the smell of fear on his victims. One girl fights back and puts a javelin stick through the creeper's eye and head, but it doesn't kill him. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)(spoiler alert)The very end, after the sheriff supposedly destroys the Creeper. Then a scene is shown 3 kids visiting a roadside stand advertising the &quot;Bat from Hell&quot; and they're told that the man's dad killed it. They pay their money and see the Creeper mounted on the wall. The Creeper's arm is shown as being sewn back on (he loses it right before he is killed). The sheriff appears as an older man; the kids ask him what he is armed for. He tells them that it's been almost 23 years and he knows that the evil thing will be back to feed again for 23 years. Thus setting us up for Jeepers Creepers 3!! And please remember folks, 23 years isn't a very long time!
