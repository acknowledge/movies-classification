The film follows Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller), a 40-year-old man who has recently suffered a nervous breakdown and is now struggling to just &quot;do nothing.&quot; He returns to L.A., where he had grown up and had a semi-successful rock band, and housesits for his brother, Phillip (Chris Messina), while he and his family are away on an extended vacation. Greenberg meets his brother's assistant, Florence (Greta Gerwig), and begins a halting, awkward romance with her. He reconnects with his old band mates -- including Ivan (Rhys Ifans) -- who are still bitter about a record deal that Roger ruined 15 years ago. Roger also attempts to date Beth (Jennifer Jason Leigh), an old girlfriend, but she rejects him.While Roger is housesitting, Phillip's dog becomes sick, forcing Roger to take responsibility for his care. Toward the end of the film, his twenty-something niece arrives, throws a wild, drug-filled party in the house, and then leaves for Australia -- tempting Roger to go with her.
