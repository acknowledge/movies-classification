This movie is a complete spoof of the Freddie Prinz/Rachel Leigh Cook movie &quot;She's All That.&quot; It is a great takeoff with lines appropriately modified to fit the satire genre and even includes a word for word reference to one of Freddie's lines in the original movie. From the minute I started watching this flick, I knew exactly what it was about and exactly where it was going. It was corny, but I enjoyed every minute of it.
