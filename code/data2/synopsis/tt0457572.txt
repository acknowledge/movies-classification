In this savage satire of American society, we find ourselves following a little boy, Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray), through an alternate version of the white-bread 1950s of big-finned cars, houses with white picket fences, and prejudice, except that instead of Blacks there are zombie servants animated by space radiation, but kept under control with Zomcon zombie collars. Timmy is delighted with the family's first zombie (Billy Connolly), whom he names Fido, although his father, Bill Robinson (Dylan Baker), is terrified of zombies, and only bought Fido at the urging of his wife, Helen (Carrie-Anne Moss). Bill is only interested in golf and in funeral rights to make sure that they will all stay dead when they die, and not become zombies themselves. Fido becomes Timmy's best friend, while the neighborhood playboy (Tim Blake Nelson) keeps a young female zombie named Tammy (Sonja Bennett) as his girlfriend. Fido runs afoul of prejudice, circumstance, hardware faults in the Zomcon collars, and neighborhood bullies. Before we are done, there is murder and assorted other mayhem, zombification, dezombification, a full-scale zombie riot at Zomcon, and the death of Timmy's father as a result of the evil Zomcon security chief's (Henry Czerny) attempt to throw Timmy to the rioting zombies in order to protect company secrets. Fido then rescues Timmy and kills the security chief. But all's well that ends well, as Fido is restored to his family, and the widow discovers that she is happier with Fido than with her late husband.
